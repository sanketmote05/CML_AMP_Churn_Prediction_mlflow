# Part 8A: Saving Model to Model Registry using API

# This script is used to move  the experiment with the best performance ( Target. KPIs)  to the Model Registry 
# in CML and then subsequently (See 8B_deploy_registered_model) take the latest version of the model from Model
# registry  and deploy it as an API Endpoint

# If you haven't yet, run through the initialization steps in the README file and Part 1 and Part4.In Part 1, 
# the data is imported into the table you specified in Hive. All data accesses fetch from Hive.
# In Part 4, the model is trained with different parameters and the outputs are logged as MLFlow Experiments
# We will take the best performing experiment run as a starting point for building our pipeline
# Filtering runs we use MLFlow API , and can include nuanced filtering such as below 
# filter_string="metric.test_score < 0.71 and metric.test_score > 0.6", 
#
#
# There is  1 other way of running this script, which is as a deployment pipeline. You could add this as a job 
# and schedule it as dependent on Train Model Job , If this has been created earlier
# ***Scheduled Jobs***
#
# The **[Jobs](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/jobs-pipelines/topics/ml-creating-a-pipeline.html)**
# feature allows for adhoc, recurring and depend jobs to run specific scripts. To run this model registration and
# deployment process , create a new job by going to the Project window and clicking _Jobs >
# New Job_ and entering the following settings:
# * **Name** : Register and Deploy Model
# * **Script** : 8A_register_model.py
# * **Arguments** : _Leave blank_
# * **Kernel** : Python 3
# * **Schedule** : Manual
# * **Engine Profile** : 1 vCPU / 2 GiB
# The rest can be left as is. Once the job has been created, click **Run** to start a manual
# run for that job.

# *** working with CML APIv2 ( SDK)***
# The code here demonstrates using CML APIv2 to automate different MLOps tasks
# Step 1 : We will query CML Experiments with a filter criteria to obtain the best performing experiment run above 
#          our threshold values of target performance metric
# Step 2 : We will register this experiment run in CML Model Registry
