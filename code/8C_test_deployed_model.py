# Part 8C: Testing Deployed Model for Inferencing

# This script is used to test an API Endpoint for inferencing. This should be used after Steps 1,4,8A,8B are completed
#  The assumption is that you already have deployed the model as an API endpoint. 
# If you haven't yet, run through the initialization steps in the README file and Part 1 and Part4 and Part 8a, Part8b.
# There is one other way to use this script. You can create this as a Job pipeline and make it dependent on 8B_deploy_registered_model
